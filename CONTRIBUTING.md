# Contributing to Workouts

This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the Workouts project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (for package management)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brylie/workouts.git
   cd workouts/app
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Project Structure

- `src/lib/` - Contains core functionality:

  - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `database.ts` - IndexedDB database interactions via Dexie
  - `exercises.ts` - Exercise filtering and workout generation
  - `muscles.ts` - Muscle group enums
  - `joints.ts` - Joint definitions
  - `equipment.ts` - Equipment enums
  - `components/` - Reusable Svelte components
  - `exercise_data/` - Exercise definitions by category

- `src/routes/` - SvelteKit routes:
  - `/` - Home page
  - `/exercises/` - Exercise catalog
  - `/workout/` - Workout planning and tracking
  - `/history/` - Exercise history and reporting
  - `/guidelines/` - Training guidelines

## Coding Standards

### Svelte 5 Runes

This project uses Svelte 5 with the new runes syntax. Use `$state()`, `$derived()`, etc. instead of the older `$:` reactive syntax:

```svelte
<script>
  // Use this (Svelte 5 runes)
  let count = $state(0);
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);

  // Instead of this (Svelte < 5)
  // let count = 0;
  // $: doubled = count * 2;
</script>
```

### Imports

- Prefer absolute imports from `$lib` over relative imports
- Use consistent import ordering (built-ins, then external packages, then internal modules)

```ts
// Correct
import { browser } from "$app/environment";
import type { WorkoutItem } from "$lib/types";
import { saveCompletedExercise } from "$lib/database";

// Avoid mixing styles
import { browser } from "$app/environment";
import type { WorkoutItem } from "../lib/types"; // Bad: relative import
import { saveCompletedExercise } from "$lib/database";
```

### Semantic Element Naming

Add semantic classes or IDs to important DOM elements for testing and self-documentation:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<div class="workout-item">
  <h3 class="exercise-title">{item.exercise.title}</h3>
  <div class="exercise-metrics">...</div>
</div>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div>
  <h3>{item.exercise.title}</h3>
  <div>...</div>
</div>
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run only unit tests during development (faster than running all tests):

```bash
cd app
pnpm test:unit
```

### End-to-End Tests

Run end-to-end tests when needed:

```bash
cd app
pnpm test:e2e
```

### All Tests

Run all tests before submitting PRs:

```bash
cd app
pnpm test
```

## Adding Dependencies

To add a new dependency:

```bash
cd app
pnpm add <package-name>
```

For dev dependencies:

```bash
cd app
pnpm add -D <package-name>
```

## Build and Deploy

```bash
cd app
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `app/build` directory.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests to ensure everything works
4. Submit a pull request
