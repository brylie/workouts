# Contributing to Workouts

This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the Workouts project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (for package management)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) (for database migrations)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brylie/workouts.git
   cd workouts/app
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up Supabase (optional, for backend development)
   
   If you're working with the Supabase backend, you'll need to set up your local environment:
   
   ```bash
   # Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already
   npm install -g supabase
   
   # Login to Supabase
   supabase login
   
   # Link to your Supabase project (get the reference ID from the project settings)
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Working with Supabase

### Database Migrations

The project uses Supabase migrations to manage database schema changes. Migrations are stored in the `supabase/migrations/` directory.

#### Creating a New Migration

To create a new migration:

```bash
cd app
supabase migration new name_of_migration
```

This will create a new SQL file in the `supabase/migrations/` directory with a timestamp prefix.

#### Checking Migration Status

To see which migrations have been applied locally and remotely:

```bash
supabase migration list
```

#### Applying Migrations

To apply pending migrations to your local database:

```bash
supabase migration up
```

To push migrations to the remote Supabase instance:

```bash
supabase db push
```

#### Troubleshooting Migrations

If you encounter issues with migration synchronization between local and remote databases:

1. List the current migration status:
   ```bash
   supabase migration list
   ```

2. Repair migration history if needed:
   ```bash
   # Mark a migration as reverted
   supabase migration repair --status reverted <migration_version>
   
   # Mark a migration as applied
   supabase migration repair --status applied <migration_version>
   ```

3. Pull the current database schema:
   ```bash
   supabase db pull
   ```

### Environment Variables for Supabase

Create a `.env` file in the `app` directory with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Supabase connection
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# For subscription functionality
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

See `STRIPE_SETUP.md` for more details on setting up the subscription system.

## Project Structure

The project code is in the `app/` directory. All commands should be run from this directory. Console commands will automatically be run in the app/ directory.

- `src/lib/` - Contains core functionality (service layer):

  - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `database.ts` - IndexedDB database interactions via Dexie
  - `exercises.ts` - Exercise filtering and workout generation
  - `muscles.ts` - Muscle group enums
  - `joints.ts` - Joint definitions
  - `equipment.ts` - Equipment enums
  - `components/` - Reusable Svelte components
  - `exercise_data/` - Exercise definitions by category
  - `server/` - Server-side code for API endpoints

- `src/routes/` - SvelteKit routes:
  - `/` - Home page
  - `/exercises/` - Exercise catalog
  - `/workout/` - Workout planning and tracking
  - `/history/` - Exercise history and reporting
  - `/guidelines/` - Training guidelines
  - `/api/` - Server API endpoints

Business logic should reside mainly in the lib folder (service layer) so templates can remain thin.

## Coding Standards

### Package Management

This project uses pnpm for package management. Always use pnpm commands for installing, updating, or removing dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Add a new dependency
pnpm add <package-name>

# Add a dev dependency
pnpm add -D <package-name>
```

### Svelte 5 Runes

This project uses Svelte 5 with the new runes syntax. Use `$state()`, `$derived()`, etc. instead of the older `$:` reactive syntax:

```svelte
<script>
  // Use this (Svelte 5 runes)
  let count = $state(0);
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);

  // Instead of this (Svelte < 5)
  // let count = 0;
  // $: doubled = count * 2;
</script>
```

### Imports

- Prefer absolute imports from `$lib` over relative imports
- Don't mix absolute and relative imports
- Relative imports in the same directory are acceptable
- Use consistent import ordering (built-ins, then external packages, then internal modules)

```ts
// Correct
import { browser } from "$app/environment";
import type { WorkoutItem } from "$lib/types";
import { saveCompletedExercise } from "$lib/database";

// Avoid mixing styles
import { browser } from "$app/environment";
import type { WorkoutItem } from "../lib/types"; // Bad: relative import
import { saveCompletedExercise } from "$lib/database";
```

### UI Components

We use Tailwind CSS for styles and daisyUI for semantic components. Where possible, prefer daisyUI components for clean template code.

### Semantic Element Naming

Add semantic classes or IDs to important DOM elements for testing and self-documentation:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<div class="workout-item">
  <h3 class="exercise-title">{item.exercise.title}</h3>
  <div class="exercise-metrics">...</div>
</div>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div>
  <h3>{item.exercise.title}</h3>
  <div>...</div>
</div>
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run only unit tests during development (faster than running all tests):

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

When improving unit test coverage, run only the unit tests since running e2e tests may be unnecessary.

### End-to-End Tests

Run end-to-end tests when needed:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

### All Tests

Run all tests before submitting PRs:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Adding Dependencies

To add a new dependency:

```bash
cd app
pnpm add <package-name>
```

For dev dependencies:

```bash
cd app
pnpm add -D <package-name>
```

## Build and Deploy

```bash
cd app
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `app/build` directory.
