                    <h3 class="font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2">Why it matters</h3>
                    <p>Training each muscle group twice weekly provides an optimal balance between stimulating muscle growth and allowing adequate recovery. This frequency ensures consistent progress while reducing the risk of overtraining.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-400">8 - 12 Rep Range</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">When using weights, start with a weight level that you can only do around 8 reps before maxing out. Continue at that weight level across workouts until you can do 12 reps before maxing out. Then increase the weight level the next time you do that exercise.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2">Why it matters</h3>
                    <p>The 8 - 12 rep range is widely regarded as the optimal range for hypertrophy (muscle growth). It provides a balance between mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle fatigue, which are key factors for muscle development.</p>
